## CodeVertex
I had the valuable opportunity to work as a Frontend Development Intern at Code Vertex, where I honed my skills in building responsive, user-friendly web interfaces. During the internship, I actively contributed to the design and development of interactive UI components using modern technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I collaborated with UI/UX designers and backend developers to ensure seamless integration and a smooth user experience across various platforms. My responsibilities also included debugging, optimizing code performance, and implementing design enhancements based on client feedback. This experience not only strengthened my technical foundation in frontend development but also deepened my understanding of real-world software development workflows and teamwork in an agile environment.
